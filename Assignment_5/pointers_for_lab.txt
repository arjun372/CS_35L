1.Compile 'C' only
gcc -std=c99 binsortu.c

2. double *x, y, z ; // only 

3. pointers, pointers to functions

4. Dynamic memory management :: 
   a. malloc - constructor not called - allocates memory from sys heap. returns a VOID pointer to start of mem block
      malloc CAN fail.  Handle this case correctly. 
   b. free   - destrcutor not called
   c. Realloc  :: May or may not change mem ardrress. always make sure its the correct 

Memory for pointer :: in stack
Memory for memiry  :: in heap

ptr[1].BR.X = 5
(ptr+1) -> BR.X = 5

putchar, getchar  --> from stdin, stdout only

scanf("%d", &i);

gcc -g // for debugging
