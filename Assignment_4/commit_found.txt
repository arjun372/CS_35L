    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
    
    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.

    * man/help2man: Update to 1.40.4 version, with quoting fixed as above.
